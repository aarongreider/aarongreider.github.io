        <i>Nice to meet you, I'm Aaron</i>
        <br><br>Design is something of an ideal. 
        <br>Escaping the world to create a new one... 
        <br>To express a concept and evoke an experience.

        <br><br>Every decision must be calculated.
        <br>There must be a reason, 
        <br>a metaphor,
        <br>a greater good to consider from process to execution.
        
        <br><br>A designer makes a statement of identity through many media to craft an experience that can engulf and
        persuade a user.

        <br><br>With each challenge, I see an opportunity to prove myself;
        <br>I've hand coded this website to stand out from my
        peers and
        to display my work the best it can be.
