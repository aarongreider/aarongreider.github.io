            <p class="description">I created six illustrations bound together in a booklet based on the
                classic nonsense poem by Lewis Carroll.</p>

            <p class="subTitle">It's Nonsense</p>
            <p class="processDescription">
                ’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
                <br>Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
                <br>All mimsy were the borogoves,
                <br>And the mome raths outgrabe.
                <br><br>“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
                <br>The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
                <br>Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
                <br>The frumious Bandersnatch!”
                <br><br>He took his vorpal sword in hand;
                <br>Long time the manxome foe he sought—
                <br>So rested he by the Tumtum tree
                <br>And stood awhile in thought.
                <br><br>And, as in uffish thought he stood,
                <br>The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
                <br>Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
                <br>And burbled as it came!
                <br><br>One, two! One, two! And through and through
                <br>The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
                <br>He left it dead, and with its head
                <br>He went galumphing back.
                <br><br>“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
                <br>Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
                <br>O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”
                <br>He chortled in his joy.
                <br><br>’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
                <br>Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
                <br>All mimsy were the borogoves,
                <br>And the mome raths outgrabe.
            </p>
            <p class="processDescription"><br><br><br>Even before I began my analysis of the poem,
                I knew that I
                wanted to take a the poem on a walk down the opposite direction of Disney’s or Tim
                Burton’s take on the Alice in Wonderland
                canon. I wanted to make it decisively darker by drawing parallels between the actions
                of the hero and the sins of man.
                I adapted stylistic elements from the late horror artist Bernie Wrightson to create a
                more dubious and brooding
                atmosphere.
                <br><br>The poem is comprised of seven stanzas (I illustrated the latter six), which I
                drew parallel to each of the seven deadly sins in my planning process - in the order of
                Greed, Lust, Sloth, Envy, Wrath, Pride, and Gluttony respective
                to each stanza. These attributes shaped how I presented each illustration emotionally.
            </p>
            <p class="subTitle">Analysis</p>
            <p class="photoDescription">The first Illustration deals with the hero’s greed manifest
                upon being sent to conquer
                and destroy. </p>

            <hr class="line">

            <p class="photoDescription">The second
                represents his sloth at the base of the Tumtum tree. The scene presents his action of
                sloth and juxtaposes it with his
                persistence to act on greed. I placed emphasis on his hand to show it as his “vorpal
                sword,” the lack of a weapon is a
                metaphor for brutality of his own doing.</p>

            <p class="photoDescription">Acting on it’s envy, the Jabberwocky releases itself upon the

            <p class="photoDescription">The fourth illustration is from the Jabberwocky’s perspective
                to emphasize it as the victim of wrath as well as
                its own envy, and to evoke a sense of danger as the eyeless hero stares straight at
                the viewer.</p>

            <p class="photoDescription">
                I created a translation of the first and last stanza to clearly portray my
                interpretation:
                <br><br>
                It’s sunny, and the tree branches
                <br>Did sway in the wind:
                <br>All happy are our friends
                <br>And the wildlife reaches out
                <br><br>
                As the first stanza, it sets a scene of a forest with plentiful wildlife and coexisting
                establishment. As the last stanza, it
                shows nature running its course on
                the hero who, too intoxicated to defend himself, is graben by the force he grabed.
            </p>

            <p class="photoDescription">The booklet I created was intended to be a maze to flip
                through, making the viewing
                experience of the poem as confusing
                as the language used.</p>
