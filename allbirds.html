            With only a week to put in as much work as we could,
            we were <b>voted both Audience Choice and Runner Up,</b> and awarded
            a $400 prize and a brand new pair of shoes.

            ‚ÄúSometimes, the assumption with innovation is it‚Äôs about adding lots of things... bells and whistles,
            and, in the case of what we were asked often in the early days: ‚ÄòWhy does the world need another
            shoe?‚Äô ...sometimes innovation can be about taking things away. It can be whispering when everyone else
            is
            screaming.‚Äù
            <br><br>‚Äî Tim Brown
        </aside>
        <p>We applied the same logic to the current state of Allbirds packaging, as when Tim Brown speaks of his
            shoe
            design. Innovation for such a sustainable brand should be about taking things away, while adding value
            to the brand.</p>

        <img src="Graphics/Allbirds/allbirds_pres-06.jpg">

        <p>We began by analyzing the theory behind Allbirds current packaging, combined with
            testing multiple design iterations
            through prototyping, we came up with two solutions for new sustainable package methods.
            <br><br>
            Our designs incorporated all the success of the current packaging while enhancing the consumer unboxing
            experience and
            requiring less material in their construction.

        <h2>The Solution of Today</h2>
        <p>
            With a more traditional box approach we wanted to focus on the sensory appeal of the unboxing. When you open
            the box, the shoes fall in line as if they were walking already, underneath the shoes you reveal brand
            messaging, and we wanted to create a box you would want to keep your shoes in.
            <br><br>
            The box approach was to some extent serendipitous, we destroyed the current show box and discovered the
            beauty of the curves, and thought ‚Äì what can we do with this?
        </p>

        <aside>What were we shooting for?<br><br>
            porch packaging, not too flashy<br>
            embossed logo, a new plane of tactile pleasure<br>
            emphasis on the soft, versatile curves that are essential to the Allbirds brand<br>
            pizza-box tension system makes a satisfying aural swish without any of the traditional adhesives<br>

        <p>
            In a manufacturing environment, <b>only 2%</b> of the total material is wasted.
            <br>We didn't have statistics on the waste from the current packaging,
            but we're fairly certain this was a significant improvement.
        </p>

        <h2>The Solution of Tomorrow</h2>
        <p>
            Obviously, the most sustainable form of packaging is no packaging. So that's where we began.
            From the get go, we knew that we wanted a package that looked cohesive on shelf, was as eye catching as
            the pattern currently created by the boxes, and was ergonomically pleasing to pull off the shelf.
        </p>
        <div class="flex-row flex-two">
            <img src="Graphics/Allbirds/allbirds_process-4.jpg">
            <img src="Graphics/Allbirds/allbirds_process-5.jpg">
        </div>
        <div class="flex-row flex-two"><img src="Graphics/Allbirds/allbirds_process-8.jpg">
            <img src="Graphics/Allbirds/allbirds_process-9.jpg">

        <img src="Graphics/Allbirds/allbirds_pres-16.jpg">
        <img src="Graphics/Allbirds/allbirds_pres-17.jpg">

        <p>
            In addition to simply being more sustainable by using less material, the reduced footprint observes
            lower shipping costs as each package weighs less and more boxes can be shipped per container.
        </p>
