                Students from all majors and years were encouraged to apply to UC's off-campus maker space for an opportunity to present
                two redesigns of the Allbirds shoe packaging to Tim Brown, the CEO.
                <br><br>
                Accepted attendees received $100, with a chance to win up to an additional $400 in first place, runner up, and audience
                pick. Participants were randomly arranged in six teams to compete against each other and to present their ideas with.

                <i>“Sometimes, the assumption with innovation is it’s about adding lots of things — bells and whistles,
                and, in the case of what we were asked often in the early days — ‘Why does the world need another shoe?’ —
                sometimes innovation can be about taking things away. It can be whispering when everyone else is screaming.”</i> 
                <br>— Tim Brown
                <br><br>
                We applied the same logic to the current state of Allbirds packaging, as when Tim Brown speaks of his shoe
                design. Innovation for such a sustainable brand should be about taking things away, while adding value to the brand.

                <br><br>
                With a more traditional box approach we wanted to focus on the sensory appeal of the unboxing. When you open the
                box, the shoes fall in line as if they were walking already, underneath the shoes you reveal brand messaging, and we
                wanted to create a box you would want to keep your shoes in.
                <br><br>
                The box approach was to some extent serendipitous, we destroyed the current show box and discovered the beauty
                of the curves, and thought – what can we do with this?

                From the get go, we knew that we wanted a package that looked cohesive on shelf, was as eye catching as the
                pattern currently created by the boxes, and was ergonomically pleasing to pull off the shelf.
