        <p>The project began with a 1000 word text of our choosing; I went with a goofy story I wrote with my childhood
            best
            friends when we were in our tweens. It followed one central character as we led his people on a holy
            pilgrimage to
            Denmark, told through an infinite amount of references to video games we were playing and shows we were
            watching at the
            time, sandwiched amongst Lord of the Rings and Dungeons and Dragons references.
            <br>
            <br>From the text, I pulled many conceptual and literal motifs to visually portray. Things like conflict,
            sanctuary, and
            (most importantly) magic crayons. To read the story and see the scope of the themes I worked with, click

        </p>
        <aside>
            Many of these are an amalgam of AI-generated imagery, public domain illustration, and personal photography
            combined
            through procedural image manipulation and photoshop wizardry.

        <h2>The Immaculate Scrolls</h2>
        <p>After exploring imagery based off of the text, I abstracted the concept further by imagining what a
            currency
            in this
            universe might look like and how it might be treated. The result was <i>
                The Immaculate Scrolls; an incorruptable currency
                blessed by the five headed glacial wyrm Hiram Mcdaniels.
            </i> With each scroll, the monetary value escalates along with a
            traditional blessing according to the canon: good luck, good health, protection, wisdom, and
            balance.</p>
