                    <p class="description">The Poplar Prince’s robes were created from 101 twelve-inch poplar planks and held together with wood
                        adhesive. The initial concept was modeled and rendered in Autodesk Maya, and the succeeding mantle
                        was a loose adaption of what I could complete over the course of one all-nighter.</p>

                    <p class="title">101 Poplar Planks and Wood Glue</p>
                    <p class="description">The model was meant to liken cascading and asymmetrical movement a nontraditional ebb from bottom right
                        to upper left culminating in a fractal spiral on the left shoulder.
                        <br>
                        <br> Because the poplar planks resembled reeds, I researched styles of traditional reed armor - especially
                        that of ancient eastern shoguns. I began by creating a duct tape bust of my torso that I could use
                        to brainstorm, though, I opted to brainstorm in the digital space instead. When I began to construct
                        the mantle, I found that the skeleton made a better bust than my poplar-reinforced duct tape one.
                        To create dimension of the overall form, a tiny (>.25in) spacer made of cut, layered, and glued poplar
                        was placed between each plank. Without the spacers there would be no way to glue the sticks together.
                        Each joint was held together for 30 minutes with a clothespin to avoid damage before the adhesive
                        sealed.

                        a single entity composed of two materials with unique tactile qualities. My swatch used candle wax
                        and poplar planks.</p>

                    <p class="description">Melting the wax intrigued me, so I experimented with different factors’ effect on the cooling speed.
                        I came to the conclusion that pouring wax onto water and a dry surface simultaneously would adhere
                        the wax to the surface and quickly create a hardened structure that retained the likeness of the
                        fluid state. Because wax repels water, the wax would unconditionally adhere to itself, lending the
                        capability to create a complex wax labyrinth. I constructed a grid out of the planks which would
                        serve as structural support for a 1x1 foot wax swatch. Then using clothespins, shoelace, and a ruler
                        I created a mechanism to suspend the grid on the surface of the water (in a dishbin) so I could freely
                        pour the wax onto both the water and the poplar</p>
