                                <br><br>He took his vorpal sword in hand;
                                <br>Long time the manxome foe he sought—
                                <br>So rested he by the Tumtum tree
                                <br>And stood awhile in thought.
                                <br><br>And, as in uffish thought he stood,
                                <br>The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
                                <br>Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,

                                <br>He left it dead, and with its head
                                <br>He went galumphing back.
                                <br><br>“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
                                <br>Come to my arms, my beamish boy!

                                <br>He chortled in his joy.

                            <p class="processDescription"><br><br><br>Even before I began my analysis of the poem,
                                I knew that I
                                wanted to take a the poem on a walk down the opposite direction of Disney’s or Tim
                                Burton’s take on the Alice in Wonderland
                                canon. I wanted to make it decisively darker by drawing parallels between the actions
                                of the hero and the sins of man.
                                I adapted stylistic elements from the late horror artist Bernie Wrightson to create a
                                more dubious and brooding
                                atmosphere.
                                <br><br>The poem is comprised of seven stanzas (I illustrated the latter six), which I
                                drew parallel to each of the seven deadly sins in my planning process - in the order of
                                Greed, Lust, Sloth, Envy, Wrath, Pride, and Gluttony respective
                                to each stanza. These attributes shaped how I presented each illustration emotionally.

                                persistence to act on greed. I placed emphasis on his hand to show it as his “vorpal
                                sword,” the lack of a weapon is a
                                metaphor for brutality of his own doing.</p>

                                As the first stanza, it sets a scene of a forest with plentiful wildlife and coexisting
                                establishment. As the last stanza, it
                                shows nature running its course on
                                the hero who, too intoxicated to defend himself, is graben by the force he grabed.

                                because of their capacity to control a viewer’s bias because of it’s narrow portrayal
                                of one subject.</p>

                                present a person or animal
                                in any emotional stance, where every variable from lighting, to angle, focal length
                                and proximity can independently and subtly influence how they are percieved.

                                deals with a similar idea; in some instances, focusing an abnormal amount on a part
                                of the subject may render the subject
                                unrecognizable. In either case, details must be dealt with respect.
