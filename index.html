                                mantle was a loose adaption of what I could complete over the course of one all-nighter.</p>

                                <br> Because the poplar planks resembled reeds, I researched styles of traditional reed armor
                                - especially that of ancient eastern shoguns. I began by creating a duct tape bust of my
                                torso that I could use to brainstorm, though, I opted to brainstorm in the digital space
                                instead. When I began to construct the mantle, I found that the skeleton made a better bust
                                than my poplar-reinforced duct tape one. To create dimension of the overall form, a tiny
                                (>.25in) spacer made of cut, layered, and glued poplar was placed between each plank. Without
                                the spacers there would be no way to glue the sticks together. Each joint was held together
                                for 30 minutes with a clothespin to avoid damage before the adhesive sealed.

                                absurdly enormous amount of work we have to show for it. For the first many iterations, we
                                were charged to design by a grid, and avoid particular graphic elements. Eventually, we were
                                encouraged to spread out, to put personality and a wider variety of brand elements into our
                                composition.

                            <p class="processDescription" id="posterText3">I pursued the idea of implied space and depth for my first graphic poster. For the appearance
                                of a clean and finalized result, I used Autodesk Maya to emulate studio-lit photography with
                                renderings that implied the depth of the paper. For a paper-like effect to project text on,
                                I used 2- dimensional planes.

                                I dipped into the Blue Ash College monogram, as well as circular elements to divide space
                                and emphasize areas of the hierarchy.

                            <p class="processDescription" id="posterText5">I believe these designs were my least successful for two reasons: first, the monograms became
                                the visual focus - fighting the content and failing to show university affiliation. Second,
                                the visual elements failed to reflect the content and purpose of the poster, to sell the
                                Communication Design program. I later realized while I was coming up with my final design,
                                that this was a problem with my 2D plane iteration, too.
                            </p>
                            <p class="processDescription" id="posterText6">I needed to find something which reflected what I was designing for, something of an overarching
                                metaphor.

                            <p class="processDescription" id="posterText7">I was sitting at Panera, being a basic Panera-goer eating my bread bowl and sipping my tea. In
                                a uniquely design student fashion, I flagged a booth as my territory and immediately spread
                                all my supplies everywhere (riding the risk of spilling my soup all over my binder). The
                                mess, I realized, was composed of widely used tools for cultivating the creative process
                                by many, I imagine, across the globe. If my Bic ballpoint pen, laptop and mouse, scrap paper
                                and lunatic scrawl could be universally recognized as a setup for design, then I should be
                                able to seize such symbolism as content for my poster.

                                grid, an element associated with the pop art and grunge design movements, it seemed like
                                the perfect solution for my design.

                                - especially that of ancient eastern shoguns. I began by creating a duct tape bust of my
                                torso that I could use to brainstorm, though, I opted to brainstorm in the digital space
                                instead. When I began to construct the mantle, I found that the skeleton made a better bust
                                than my poplar-reinforced duct tape one. To create dimension of the overall form, a tiny
                                (>.25in) spacer made of cut, layered, and glued poplar was placed between each plank. Without
                                the spacers there would be no way to glue the sticks together. Each joint was held together
                                for 30 minutes with a clothespin to avoid damage before the adhesive sealed.

                            <p class="photoDescription">I've been photographing things since I was a little kid. I remember receiving my DSi- the first
                                Nintendo portable device with a camera- which I took everywhere with me. During a family
                                vacation to Yellowstone National Park, it was clear that this little kid had a passion for
                                taking pictures. Landscapes? Document. Wildlife? Document. Food? Document. The week we spent
                                camping and hiking around yielded over 3,000 photos of the amazing things we'd seen.
                                <br>
                                <br>Fast forward 8 years, as senior in high school I received a DSLR camera for my birthday.
                                I brought this camera on every trip I had that summer: a few days in New York City? 30gb.
                                RV in Alaskan Wilderness? 60gb. 350 mile Biking Trip? 45gb. Even if it fails to become a
                                career, photography will remain a part myself for the rest of my life.

                                design. Each episode will cover a different designer who led the design of their time.</p>

                            <p class="processDescription">Naturally, we drew designers out of a hat. I drew a particular rebel named Neville Brody.
                                <br>
                                <br> Known for his early work for Fetish Records and his design for The Face Magazine in the
                                80’s and - later in the age of the internet - his leadership in digital font creation, dissemination,
                                and usage thereof through FUSE and FontShop.
                                <br>
                                <br>In his early days, Brody was a punk. He stayed on the forefront of design by experimentation
                                with the abstract and precedent. He disdained his professors’ instruction, as they deemed
                                his work “uncommercial.” He was almost expelled from The Royal College of Art in London after
                                placing the Queen’s face sideways on a postage stamp design.
                                <br>
                                <br>While designing the poster, I stayed true to Brody’s attention to the defining philosophy
                                of each project that is consistent in all his work. Through each unique iteration, I explored
                                several of his unique works created through different points in his career, eventually settling
                                on the style of his early work of the 80’s.

                                    <i>The Graphic Language of Neville Brody,</i> a compilation and analysis of Brody's work
                                    by Jon Wozencroft, I came across a very intriguing set of album covers featuring a very
                                    gritty and inaccessible halftones and near-tribal markmaking - a motif and interest which
                                    spans brody's entire career. We were required to include an image of one of our designer's
                                    work, so I selected Stephen Mallinder's
                                    <i>Pow Wow</i> and integrated it's style with my work.

                                    and applied a threshold filter to achieve the two-tone black and white.</p>

                                an icon then picked a phrase associated with it to combine them in one black and white poster.
                                The poster had to exhibit clear derivative from the Fibonacci sequence and effectiveness
                                in black and white before optional completion in color.</p>

                            <p class="processDescription">This poster project was completed in tandem with the PBS Designer Series poster (which also had
                                to be designed by the Fibonacci sequence), so it’s needless to say our poster designing skills
                                were
                                <i>razor sharp</i> by the end of the semester.

                            <p class="processTextRazorHead" id="figure10Text">When developing the poster, we paid specific attention to the texture resulting from the text
                                and icon, the Fibonacci sequence, and the visual narrative each of the elements created.
                                Fairly soon into my creative process, I came up with the idea to use the words "razor sharp"
                                layered over each other to look like bristly hair, and to use the razor to shave it. I divided
                                the page down its diagonal to create two divisions that the razor’s handle would lie in the
                                center of. The head of the razor is parallel to the opposite diagonal.

                                    you can see a subtle skin texture overlayed. The combination of the saturated red and
                                    skin was intended to evoke a sense of danger or alert, implying that the razor is, in
                                    fact, razor sharp and will draw blood if used carelessly.</p>

                                    I curriculum in order to create an icon which was functional on a large and small scale.
                                    It was certainly difficult at times to come up with creative, original, and dynamic iterations.</p>

                                    with one). To nail the perspective - even after finding reference photos - I created

                            I came to the conclusion that pouring wax onto water and a dry surface simultaneously would adhere
                            the wax to the surface and quickly create a hardened structure that retained the likeness of
                            the fluid state. Because wax repels water, the wax would unconditionally adhere to itself, lending
                            the capability to create a complex wax labyrinth. I constructed a grid out of the planks which
                            would serve as structural support for a 1x1 foot wax swatch. Then using clothespins, shoelace,
                            and a ruler I created a mechanism to suspend the grid on the surface of the water (in a dishbin)
                            so I could freely pour the wax onto both the water and the poplar</p>
